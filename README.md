# File Integrity Monitoring Using YARA Rules

![File Integrity Monitoring](https://github.com/AshrafDesai/File_Integrity_Monitoring_tool/assets/132386307/ef78987d-9208-41f5-b0ea-1150dc336cca)

## Overview
This is a simple File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system that utilizes YARA rules to monitor file changes. It scans for modifications in files and notifies the user if any unexpected alterations are detected.

## Features
- **Monitoring**: Monitors file integrity based on YARA rules.
- **Detection**: Detects unauthorized modifications in files.
- **Alerting**: Notifies users about file integrity status changes.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- YARA tool installed
- YARA rule file (*.yar)
- Configuration file (`config.ini`)
- Target file to monitor

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- Install the YARA tool.

### 2. Create Configuration File
Create a `config.ini` file with the following content:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
YARA_RULE_PATH = "path/to/your/yara/rule.yar"
FILE_PATH = "path/to/target/file"
```

Replace `"path/to/your/yara/rule.yar"` with the path to your YARA rule file and `"path/to/target/file"` with the path to the file you want to monitor.

### 3. Run the Monitoring System
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing the monitoring system files.
- Execute the command:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Note:** Ensure you update the paths in the `config.ini` file according to your file locations.
